## Eco-Advice Page Configuration

### Google Docs Integration

The eco-advice articles are dynamically rendered from Google Docs. To set up new articles:

1. Create your article in Google Docs
2. Set sharing permissions:
   - Click 'Share' in the top right
   - Select 'Publish to web'
   - Enable auto-republish option
   - Copy the published URL

### Article Component Setup

Each article is rendered using the `parseDoc` function. To add or modify articles:

1. Locate the article component in the codebase
2. Find the `parseDoc` function
3. Insert the published Google Docs URL:
   ```javascript
   parseDoc('YOUR_PUBLISHED_GOOGLE_DOC_URL_HERE')
   ```

### OpenAI Configuration

The eco-advice page interfaces with OpenAI's API for additional functionality:

1. Navigate to `utils/openai.js`
2. On line 11, update the OpenAI endpoint URL:
   ```javascript
   const OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT = 'YOUR_OPENAI_ENDPOINT_URL'
   ```

### Important Notes

- Ensure all Google Docs are set to auto-publish to maintain current content
- Only use published sharing links from authorised product owners
- Keep OpenAI endpoint URLs secure and never commit them directly to the repository
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive URLs and endpoints
```
