# Inside My Closet

The In My Closet Project is an innovative application designed to promote sustainable fashion choices by helping users manage their wardrobe efficiently. Through features like outfit planning, wardrobe categorization, and AI-powered sustainability tips, we empower users to make the most of their existing clothes and reduce impulse purchases. The application allows users to track their clothing items, create and save outfit combinations, and access educational content about sustainable fashion practices. By encouraging users to shop their own wardrobe first and make informed decisions about new purchases, we help reduce textile waste and combat fast fashion's environmental impact. Our platform combines practical organization tools with sustainability education, creating a mindful approach to personal style that benefits both the user and the planet.
